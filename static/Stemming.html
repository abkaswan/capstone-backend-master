<p>In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. </p>
A stemmer for English operating on the stem cat should identify such strings as <i>cats</i>, <i>catlike</i>, and <i>catty</i>. A stemming algorithm might also reduce the words <i>fishing</i>, <i>fished</i>, and <i>fisher</i> to the stem <i>fish</i>. The stem need not be a word, for example the Porter algorithm reduces, <i>argue</i>, <i>argued</i>, <i>argues</i>, <i>arguing</i>, and <i>argus</i> to the stem <i>argu</i>.

<h3>What happens if I select 'Yes' for word stemming?</h3>
<p>All words in the documents are reduced to their stemmed form, i.e., 'argue', 'argued', 'argues', 'arguing', and 'argus' are reduced to the stem 'argu'.</p>
<p>There are different stemming algorithm and Porter algorithm is used by this application.</p>
