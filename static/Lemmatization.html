<p>Lemmatization in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form. In computational linguistics, lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma of a word based on its intended meaning. Unlike stemming, lemmatisation depends on correctly identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence, as well as within the larger context surrounding that sentence, such as neighboring sentences or even an entire document.</p>
<p>In many languages, words appear in several inflected forms. For example, in English, the verb 'to walk' may appear as 'walk', 'walked', 'walks' or 'walking'. The base form, 'walk', that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the <i>lemma</i> for the word.</p>
<p>The word "better" has "good" as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up.</p>
<p>The word "walk" is the base form for the word "walking", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization.</p>

<h3>What happens if I select 'Yes' for word lemmatization?</h3>
<p>All the words in the document get lemmatized, i.e., rocks -> rock, corpora -> corpus, better -> good.</p>
<p>The advantage of using this cleaning method is that words like 'better' and 'good' won't be considered as different words anymore.</p>
