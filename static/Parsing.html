<h3>TF-IDF</h3>
<p>TF-IDF stands for <b>term frequency, inverse-document frequency</b>. It is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It follows the <b>bag-of-words model</b>.</p>

<p>If you select TF-IDF option, the list of unique words (after performing stemming or lemmatization if either option is chosen) are extracted. The TF-IDF value of each word in each document in the corpus is calculated. Each document in the corpus can represent each file if multiple files are uploaded. It can represent each paragraph if one file is uploaded. If the word doesn't exist in the specific file or paragraph the TF-IDF value is calculated as 0.</p>
<p> You can see the results in the <b>Display Data</b> tab.</p>
<h3>LDA</h3>
<p>LDA stands for <b>latent Dirichlet allocation</b>. It s a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.</p>

<p>When you choose the LDA option, you can choose the number of topics you want the list of words to be grouped in. Each Topic becomes a column (Topic1, Topic2, and so on) and the LDA values of each topic in each document in the document corpus is calculated.</p>
<p>Just like TF-IDF calculation, each document can represent each paragraph if 1 file is uploaded or 1 file if multiple files are uploaded. The result table can be seen in the <b>Display Data</b> tab. If you want to see the number of words in each topic, you can choose the <b>Topic Modelling</b> option in the <b>Data Modelling - Unstructured</b> tab.
